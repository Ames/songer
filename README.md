songer
======
This is the iOS client for an app development practice project.


Songer lets you create playlists of songs from MediaNet: http://www.mndigital.com/
Playlists are synced to a server. see: https://github.com/mserran2/songer


Songer targets iphone/ipod running iOS6 and iOS7.

Two frameworks are used:
	RestKit  -  for interacting with the REST api
	SDWebImage  -  for loading images from remote servers.
